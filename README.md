# tetris-game
Tetris coded in Java using Swing and Abstract Web Toolkit for graphics

To run, ensure that all files are in the same folder.  Then compile and run Tetris.java

Right arrow to move the piece right
Left arrow to move the piece left
Up arrow to roate the piece (note that the piece will not rotate if it is too close to the another piece, or any of the 4 borders of the grid)
Down arrow to move the piece down
Spacebar to instantly drow the piece
C to swap pieces

For some reason keyboard input does not work on Windows 11, but works fine on Linux.  I'd like to fix this some time in the future.
